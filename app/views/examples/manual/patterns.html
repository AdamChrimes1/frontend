                            <p>We know that these patterns help users find what they need. They will also make your service consistent with other NHS services.</p>

                            <p>We are continuing to test and improve them and we are working on new patterns, including components for forms. If you can’t find what you want here, contact us on the NHS.UK #standards Slack channel or email the standards team at service-manual@nhs.net.</p>


                            <h2>Creating or changing patterns</h2>
    
                            <p>You're welcome to adapt one of these patterns or to create a new one. Check with us first on the NHS.UK #standards Slack channel or email us at service-manual@nhs.net. We may already be working on what you need.</p>

                            <p>Help improve the manual by contributing your work.</p>

                                <li>avoid repeating work done by other teams</li>
                                <li>build on the research and experience of other teams</li>
                                <li>make your service consistent with other NHS services</li>
